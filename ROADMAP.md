### Priority 2: Visual Flow Builder (Working UI)
- Complete flow builder save functionality
- Add node configuration panels
- Implement flow validation
- Add flow testing capability
- Create basic flow templates

### Priority 3: Triggers Implementation
- Comment → DM trigger
- Story Reply → DM trigger
- @Mention → DM trigger
- Connect triggers to flows
- Add trigger filtering (keywords, post scope)

- Visual indicators in inbox

---

## 📊 **PHASE 3: Analytics & Monitoring (1 week)**

### Priority 1: Basic Analytics
- Message volume metrics
- Response time tracking
- Conversation completion rates
- Flow performance stats
- Real-time dashboard

### Priority 2: Queue Monitoring
- Queue depth visualization
- Failed message tracking
- Retry management
- Rate limit monitoring

---

## 🚀 **PHASE 4: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)**

### Priority 1: User Attributes & Segmentation

- Tag-based segmentation
- Custom fields
- Attribute-based conditions in flows

### Priority 2: Integrations

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (This Week)**

### Day 1-2: Test End-to-End Flow
1. Create a simple test flow in UI
2. Set up a trigger (e.g., keyword trigger)
3. Test: Send DM → Webhook → Flow Execution → Auto-Reply
4. Fix any issues in the pipeline

### Day 3-4: Complete Flow Builder
1. Implement save flow functionality
2. Add flow activation/deactivation
3. Test creating different node types
4. Add flow preview/test mode

### Day 5-7: Implement Basic Triggers
1. Comment triggers (when someone comments on your post)
2. Connect to Instagram comment webhooks
3. Test: Comment on post → Send auto DM
4. Add keyword filtering

## 📋 **Technical Debt to Address**

1. **Fix schema mismatches** - Some fields referenced in code don't match DB schema
2. **Complete InstagramClient class** - Implement all sending methods
3. **Add proper error handling** - Throughout webhook and flow processing
4. **Implement retry logic** - For failed messages and API calls
5. **Add rate limiting** - Respect Instagram's 200 msgs/hour limit
6. **Set up monitoring** - Sentry for errors, logs for debugging

## 🔑 **Key Features Still Missing**

### Core Automation:
- ❌ Flow execution engine not connected to webhooks
- ❌ Trigger processing not implemented
- ❌ Message queuing not active
- ❌ Flow step processing incomplete

### User Experience:
- ❌ Can't create/save flows in UI yet
- ❌ No way to test flows before going live
- ❌ Inbox doesn't show real conversations
- ❌ Can't manually reply to messages

### Integrations:
- ❌ No webhook actions
- ❌ No external API calls
- ❌ No data export
